2)Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
HTTP is the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

HTTP1.1 connection speed is lower. where as in HTTP2.0 connection speed is faster.
HTTP1.1 is risk for network congestion. but in HTTP2.0 there is no network congestion
Page loading time is more in HTTP1.1 and Page loading time is less in HTTP2.0
HTTP1.1 it sends the data one by one. but in HTTP2.0 can send multiple data at a time due to multiflexing mechanism.




3)Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript
	Objects in Javascript is complex data type. because it can hadle more number of values at a time.
	
Object is the Key-Value pair of data type.
It is a unordered collection of related data in the form of Key-Value pair.
we ca n access the properties using two notations;
1)dot notation:
	Using dot notation we can access the data as like blow syntax.
	e.g objectName.propertyName
2) Bracket Notation:
	Objects are sometimes called associative arrays
	Each propeerty is associated with the string values in this notatation.
	e.g)
	ObjectName['proertyName']=Value
	propertyName that has  s space or hyphen or started with Number can only accessed with this Bracket Notation.
	

Creating Objects:
Object Literals can be created in 3 ways.
1) Using "new" Keyword.
	This kind is hepful in using constructor functions.

2) Object.Create() menthod.
	this method is also useful to create the Objects.
	This method allows to use the Object.prototype.
	This method doesnot require to create the constructor functions.

3) Using explicit menthod using curly brace.
	this method is normally using.
	e,g)
	let objectName={
	name:"xxx",
	age:52,
	}
